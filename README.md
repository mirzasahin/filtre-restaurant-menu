# Japanese Restaurant Website
***
> **Japanese Restaurant Website Project**
	
In this project, I made the Japanese Restaurant Website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and JavaScript. I worked on this project to improve my skills in Bootstrap CSS, and JavaScript.

During this process, I learned how to implement menu transitions and filtering using JavaScript.

Any feedback, opinions, or suggestions are very welcome!
